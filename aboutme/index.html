    <h2>My nick name is Vasquez</h2>
    <p>Hi Fellas! as you can see above my name is Diego Vasquez, I'm from El Salvador, born and raised, but my family moved to Belgium while I was on my mission, 
        so currently I'm living in Belgium. I'm really excited to begin this wonderful experience in this course, when I was younger I studied machines in High School
        and the world of computers caught my attention since that moment. Right now it's my first semester on byui and I'm pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Technology.
        I know that it's going to be a good semester!</p>
    <p>My hobbies are football(soccer haha) games or series, I enjoyed last month because the world cup, I tried my best to watch every game but I stopped because it was a
        litte bit obsesive. When I have free time my first option it's to check which football game is on.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since the day I was born, my parents were baptized when they were young and served as missionaries, 
        so from a young age I had the desire to be a missionary and my dream was fulfilled when I was assigned to the Mexico Pachuca mission. 
        I can say that this experience has made me very happy and I learned things that I continue to put into practice.</p>
